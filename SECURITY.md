# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Fixes go into the next Marketplace release. There are no maintenance branches, so only the latest published
version is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report privately through GitHub: open this repository's **Security** tab and choose **Report a vulnerability**.
Please do not use a public issue, pull request or discussion for a security problem.

Include what an attacker can reach, the steps to reproduce it, the extension version (VS Code's **Extensions**
view, or `code --list-extensions --show-versions`), your OS, and the cluster and scheduler if the report involves
the remote path. Redact tokens, hostnames and usernames you do not want published. We will acknowledge the report
and say whether we can reproduce it before any fix ships.

## Scope

CS Bridge runs in your local VS Code and drives a cluster you already have SSH access to. These are the boundaries
it is built around; a report is most useful when it shows one of them failing.

- The private half of a session's SSH key never leaves the local machine; only the public half is handed to the agent.
- The only writes to `~/.ssh/config` are the `Include ~/.cybershuttle/ssh_config` line and the SSH hosts you
  add or delete yourself in the SSH Hosts view. Per-session SSH hosts go to `~/.cybershuttle/ssh_config`.
- The job receives a token scoped to hosting one Dev Tunnel, never an account credential, and that token is not
  written to the cluster filesystem.
- Authentication is VS Code's Microsoft provider; CS Bridge runs no OAuth server and stores no token of its own.
- With the `link` transport **(experimental)**, sign-in is CILogon's device grant brokered by cs-plane, and the
  credential is kept only in VS Code's SecretStorage and sent only to cs-plane. The job's link token reaches Linkspan
  only as an environment assignment on `sbatch --export=ALL`, never the job script, a command line or a file, and
  cs-plane revokes it when the session stops. The forward token stays in the extension host's memory, and every forward
  listens on 127.0.0.1 only.
- The agent binary is fetched over HTTPS with no signature check, and everything CS Bridge runs remotely runs as
  the submitting user with no privilege that user does not already have.

How each of these is implemented is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

A finding that assumes an attacker already holds the local account, or an account on the cluster as that user,
describes one of these boundaries rather than a way through it. The compute-node agent's own boundaries are in
[Linkspan's security policy](https://github.com/cyber-shuttle/linkspan/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
